# A Word-Guess Game (based on the classic "Hangman Game")

Published site: [https://bonnieho.github.io/Hangman-game/](https://bonnieho.github.io/Hangman-game/)

## Overview

This project is a simple word-guess game/app based on the classic "Hangman" format and uses a theme of team names from the National Hockey League. The app runs in a web browser and features dynamically updated HTML powered by basic, vanilla JavaScript that reacts to game-player keyboard input.

The requirements of this project were to set up a basic html page with linked css style sheets (one reset and one sheet of our own custom styles) as well as an external game.js script file to generate game play. Any images used in the execution of the game are saved to a linked images directory within the domain.

### Game Play

Since the concept is based on guessing all of the correct letters in the randomly chosen word, the following elements were included in the interface:



Display the following on the page:

Press any key to get started!

Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _

As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).




Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



Hangman Game Bonuses

Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.


HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. T


Save your whole game and its properties in an object.


Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.


Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.


Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
