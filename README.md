# Hangman-game

## Overview

This project is a classic "Hangman" app using a theme of National Hockey League team names. The app runs in a web browser and features dynamically updated HTML powered by basic JavaScript code.







In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js. Use the src attribute of the script tag to link to this file, rather than embedding the code directly in your HTML document.
In the css folder, make a file called style.css.

Also in the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code from the Meyerweb reset stylesheet. If you opt to use Bootstrap instead of writing your own CSS, skip this step, and simply include a link to Bootstrap via CDN.
In the images folder, save whatever images you plan on using.
Push the above changes to GitHub.

Choose whichever game you'd like to build. Making the Psychic game will prove less challenging than coding Hangman. However, as the challenge of the Hangman exercise provides a more comprehensive review of this week's material, we suggest attempting that assignment first.



Option One: Psychic Game (Basic)



Option Two: Hangman Game (Challenge - Recommended)



Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!


Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.



Display the following on the page:

Press any key to get started!

Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _

As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _ _ a.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).



After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.



Hangman Game Bonuses

Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.


HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. T


Save your whole game and its properties in an object.


Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.


Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.


Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.
