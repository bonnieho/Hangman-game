        			<p>Instructions:<br />
        			In the game, you are going to try to guess the name of the NHL hockey team by guessing the different letters that spell that team's name.</p>
        			<ul>
        				<li>Like Hangman, you have EIGHT guesses before the game ends.</li>
        				<li>Enter all letters as lowercase.</li>
        				<li>There are several team names with spaces in them. When guessing these, you may use the space bar.</li>
        				<li>You can continue play as long as you like - the game will keep a running tally of wins and losses during an uninterrupted session!</li>
        			</ul>
